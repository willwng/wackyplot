# Wackyplot

This is a plot helping library that I found particularly useful when writing scientific papers with multiple figures.
For example, the 17 figures in my [paper on anisotropic networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08565)

The idea is to keep plot styles consistent (e.g., figure sizes, legends, axes, file formats).
